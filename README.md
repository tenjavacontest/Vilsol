Ten Java Contest: Vilsol
========================

This is the code from Vilsol from the "Ten Java Contest"

You can see me coding live on twitch or watch the recording: http://twitch.tv/vilsol

I am going to be on the 16:00 UTC timeframe.

I am using Bukkit and Craftbukkit version 1.7.2-R0.1-SNAPSHOT

This plugin will add multiple additions to items like conveyers, item eating chests etc. It will also add some other random stuff with mobs and other things.

Sheep and Villagers were harmed in making of this plugin.
